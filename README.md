# **Code for deep-learning implementation** 
This folder includes the jupyter notebook files for implementing a deep-learning achitecture, simulating the worm-like chain (WLC) model with constant persistence lengths (for training data), and data preprocessing procedures.

# **Code for data generation**
This folder includes the jupyter notebook file for simulating the WLC model with position-dependent persistence lengths.
