This repository includes code materials used in the study **'Inferring Spatially-varying Bending Stiffness of Biopolymers with Deep-learning Approach'**.

<**Code for deep-learning implementation**> includes the jupyter notebook files for implementing a deep-learning achitecture, simulating the worm-like chain (WLC) model with constant persistence lengths (for training data), and data preprocessing procedures.
<**Code for data generation**> includes the jupyter notebook file for simulating the WLC model with position-dependent persistence lengths.
