# Lp
This repository includes code materials used in the study **'Inferring Spatially-varying Bending Stiffness of Biopolymers with Deep-learning Approach'**.

<**Code for deep-learning implementation**> includes the jupyter notebook files for implementing a deep-learning achitecture, simulating the worm-like chain (WLC) model with constant persistence lengths (for training data), and data preprocessing procedures.
# NOTE
The detailed implementation of a deep-learning model is currently withheld and will be released upon acceptance.

- `TransformerBlock`: Multi-head attention and feedforward layers (details hidden)
- `PositionalEncoding`: Trainable positional embedding (details hidden)
- `build_transformer_model`: Builds the full Keras model (hidden)

For review purposes, a minimal subset of code may be shared upon request.


<**Code for data generation**> includes the jupyter notebook file for simulating the WLC model with position-dependent persistence lengths.
